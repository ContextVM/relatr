- feat(mcp): replace health check with comprehensive stats tool

  This change replaces the basic health check functionality with a detailed statistics tool that provides comprehensive information about the service including database metrics, social graph statistics, and source public key. The new stats tool offers more insight into service health and performance than the previous health check endpoint.
